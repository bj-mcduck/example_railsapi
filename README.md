# Trufla Products
The Trufla Product API lets you search all of Trufla's current products to filter by department name, applied promo codes, and their department.

### API V1 Documentation
Documentation on how to use the V1 API and a mock server can be found on our [Stoplight Openapi spec](https://stoplight.io/p/docs/gh/brandonjmckay/trufla_bm_backend/reference/Trufla-Product-API.v1.yaml?group=master).

## Setup
To try using the API, clone this backend repo and in the command line do the following in your cloned folder:

```shell
bundle install
rails server
```
